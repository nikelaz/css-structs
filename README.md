# CSS Structs

A CSS parser written in Rust. Represents the CSS in a few simple structs - `Stylesheet`, `CSSRule`, `CSSDeclaration` and `CSSDeclarationList`.

## Status

This project is still in very early development and should not be used in any way. Expect significant refactorings that can alter everything.
